Our strategy takes heavy advantage of the fact that the position of the coffee pot will be what we expect. It is crucial that we find the lines representing the black and decker label in the box we expect, because every piece of information we estimate about the coffee pot is extracted from the relationship between the label and positions on the coffee pot. our project wouldnt work with any other coffee pot and the coffee pot must be in the exact location we expect, so it is not the most robust algorithm, however it works.

Thanks!
